"""
### Concept: LangGraph Architecture
LangGraph builds upon the concept of a **State Machine**. 
The workflow is represented as a directed graph where:

1. **Nodes**: These are Python functions. Each node receives the current `GraphState`, performing some logic (like calling an AI agent), and returns an *update* to the state.
2. **Edges**: These define the transition from one node to another (e.g., from Node A to Node B).
3. **Conditional Edges (Routing)**: Instead of a straight line, the graph can "branch". A **Router** function decides which node to go to next based on the current state.
4. **Graph Compilation**: Before running, the graph is "compiled". This validates the connections and prepares it for execution.

#### Why LangGraph?
- **Cyclic Workflows**: Unlike standard chains, LangGraph allows for loops (e.g., a "Retry" loop if code fails).
- **Human-in-the-loop**: You can pause execution at an `END` state, wait for user input, and then resume.
